        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>On the first line, we will add the !DOCTYPE html declaration with angle brackets (< >). This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>When we create the structure for our webpage, we use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework. These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (< >). These tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
                    <li>The head element contains information about the webpage or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the "head" are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The "li" element creates a list with bullet points </li>
                </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li> The " link " element goes i the " head " section under the " meta " element and before the title. </li>
          <li>a " link " element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The " rel " attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li> The " href " attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. The href attribute is using a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case, index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we must look in the assets folder, hence assets/style.css</li>
          <li> Code reference EX: " link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css " :</li>
