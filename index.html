        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>On the first line, we will add the !DOCTYPE html declaration with angle brackets (< >). This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened.</li>
          <li>When we create the structure for our webpage, we use a series of HTML elements to define the content and framework. These HTML elements are usually composed of an opening tag and a closing tag represented with angle brackets (< >). These tags contain everything that we want to include in the element. This can include content and even other nested elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the "head" are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>The "li" element creates a list with bullet points </li>
